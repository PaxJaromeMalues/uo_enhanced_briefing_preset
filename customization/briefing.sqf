		<br/>Charlie Company (together with Alpha and Bravo Company) has been inserted into North East Takistan as of T+2Days and has established a defensive Parameter around the NE airfield at 114057.
		<br/>There has been few resistance by the local Insurgents over the past 2 days. Today at sunrise this changed drastically. All three companies have been engaged by insurgent forces at sunrise.

		//If you reference new Intel on another point in the OPORD that is not already mentioned in Disposition or Composition, you made a mistake.
		//Explain all Intel in greatest detail. This is of crucial importance.
		<br/>Current Intel assumes the majority of the enemy force in Bastam Center at 0565-0895. Radio reports from local IDAP forces made clear that the isurgents did not occupy the Mosque and that the local Shaich denied insurgents any access to the mosque area. Reports say that insurgents have sofar respected all orders by the local town chiefs, as the population is armed themselves, it is expected that they will not occupy the HQ when engaged.
		<br/>East Bastam and Falar in the south, are reported to be manned by insurgent forces of unknown type and size. Reconnaissance is still under way and not expected inbefore tomorrow.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>b. COMPOSITION:</font>
		//What organic assets for support and reinforcement are available to the enemy? This scales down to the level of mentioning single weapon systems individual soldiers will fight.
		<br/>The insurgent unit comprises out of an unknown amount and type of motorized vehicles and a Platoon minus sized infantry element of mediocre skill armed with eastern block weaponary like AK47s, AKMs, RPG-7s, PKMs and RPKs. From previous engagements and reports by Alpha and Bravo Company we expect them to be Pickup-Mounted MGs, Trucks and other improvised combat vehicles with low to no armour.
		<br/>In before all radios have been taken from IDAP forces they were able to transmit that the insurgents brought a truck with what looked like materials to craft IEDs, consider them using explosive ordenance.
		<br/>Reinforcements qould arrive from East Bastam and Falar within the first 2 hours after the engagement started.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>c. STRENGTH:</font>
		//Discribe how the quantity of enemys at and around the AO will effect the mission COs unit upon time of engagement.
		<br/>The current layout of the enemy units at Bastam Center is unlikely to change upon engagement as all sofar known enemy units are bound in contact with Alpha and Bravo Company.
		<br/>If reinforcements depart, we expect no forces larger than 2 Squads with the same weaponary and assets for mobility.
		<br/>
		<br/><font color='#005aff' size='15'>2. Capabilities:</font>
		//Explain the enemys possible actions, include significant capabilities even if they seem unlikely. Any significant weapons systems and how they might be employed. Are there specific vulerabilities of the enemy we can exploit?
		<br/><font size='14'>a. MANEUVER:</font>
		<br/>The enemy has no maneuvering assets with him and is focused on defence.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>b. FIRE SUPPORT:</font>
		<br/>The insurgent forces might use rear stationed man carried mortars which sofar have not been sighted.
		<br/>Near hills might be used by enemy heavy MGs to prevent friendlies from pushing further once they entered Bastam.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>c. INTELLIGENCE:</font>
		<br/>The enemy has supperior knowledge about the terrain in the AO.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>d. MOBILITY:</font>
		<br/>The enemy might rush civilian vehicles from Falar for a hasty break of contact.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>e. AIR DEFENSE:</font>
		<br/>NONE.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>f. COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT:</font>
		<br/>The only support know of is a truck which additionally to IED building material might host additional ammunition for a prolonged defence.
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>g. COMMAND AND CONTROL:</font>
		<br/>No advanced assets for C2 are known to be in the hands of the insurgents.
		<br/>
		<br/><font color='#005aff' size='15'>3. Enemy Courses of Action:</font>
		<br/><font size='14'>a. MOST LIKELY COURSE OF ACTION (MLCOA):</font>
		//What is the enemy most likely going to do once we engage him?
		<br/>Enemy Forces have dug in and heavily fortified Bastam over night.
		<br/>When faced with overwhemling force the insurgents are likely to abandon Bastam, surrender or go for a fighting retreat.
		<br/>Prepare for EPWs (Enemy Prisoners of War).
		<br/>
		<br/><font size='14'>MOST DANGEROUS COURSE OF ACTION (MDCOA)</font>
		//What is the most dangerous thing the enemy could do and why is it so dangerous for us?
		<br/>Enemy forces will go into a fighting retreat and have prepared a counter attack or Enemy forces will not follow the Schaichs Order and occupy the IDAP HQ taking hostiles or using civilians and IDAP units as shield.
		<br/>In second case Charlie Company has orders to surround but not engage into the IDAP HQ and wait for a Special Operations Force attempt to Raid the HQ and free the hostages.

		<br/>- C'2 will then cross through C'3 seizing Bastam with defined orders as per this OPORD Paragraph II. C'2 will not use the roads leading to Bastam due to threat of IEDs. C'2 will not use indirect fires in the near of IDAP HQ.
		<br/>- Last C'3 will move into blocking position at hill 2178 east of Bastam at 097068 as per seperate OPORD.
		<br/>The decisive point of this mission is to take Bastam.
		<br/>This is decisive as it is mandatory to hold this position to accomplish the forming of the security ring around Rasman airfield.
